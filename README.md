I use docker-compose as an orchestrator. To run these containers, run:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

in a terminal. To shut down, run: 

```
docker-compose down
```

Open phpmyadmin at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
Open web browser to look at a simple php example at [http://localhost](http://localhost)
